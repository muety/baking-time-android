My implementation of Project 3 from the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd801), which I am able to participate in thanks to a scholarship by Udacity and Google ðŸ¤—.

**This is still work in progress!**

## Features
* Integrated video player
* Home screen widget
* Responsive layouts

## Improvement suggestions
* Improved offline support
* Improved caching
* Improved design
* Better exception / edge case handling
* Include [Configuration Activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/#Configuring) for widget
* Use a (scrollable) `ListView` in the widget
* Test more sensibly
* Mock API in tests
